# DecisionTree-from-Scratch

The python file (Decision Tree.ipynb) consists of the implementation of Decision Tree Supervised learning algorithm from Scratch for Classification problems. 

The CSV file (coursework2.csv) is the data used for building the model from scratch to confirm the working of the algorithm. 

The algorithm was coded which can be used and implemented on any type of classification dataset (as per my knowledge and aim of coding). Comment for any changes required to solve issues in the program. 

NOTE: The algorithm was programmed to satisfy a small proportion of marking in the assessment of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module in the degree MSc Data Science at the University of Bristol, UK.
